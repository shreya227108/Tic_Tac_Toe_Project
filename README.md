# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe Game — HTML | CSS | JavaScript

Welcome to the **Tic Tac Toe Game** — a browser-based version of the classic game built entirely with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows two players to take turns marking spaces in a 3×3 grid, with logic to detect wins and draws in real-time.

This project is a great example of beginner-level web development, focusing on DOM manipulation, event handling, and simple game logic.
